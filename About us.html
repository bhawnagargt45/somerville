We are currently studying in VII A in Somerville School Vasundhara Enclave Delhi-110096.However,our honourable names are Aaryan Chouhan and Atharv Mittal.Aaryan Chouhan has interest in Arts but at the same time he has passion of playing with new computer concepts whereas Atharv being the true companion who always supports the other one likes to make websites and invent new things.Being friends since 3-4 years we decided to trust on each other and make this astonishing website about "THE WORLD IN 2050".It took us 4 days and 3 nights to get this done!One of our major hurdles includes the online classes as we had to do the work from school also and as well as this compelling work.We would also like to give credits to our hard working teachers who always supported us mentally.We hope you all like it.
